Description: This R package allows to compute diversity measures on tripartite graphs. It first implements a parametrised family of such diversity measures applying on probability distributions. Sometimes called "True Diversity", this family contains famous measures such as the Richness, the Shannon entropy, the Herfindahlâ€“Hirschman index, and the Berger-Parker index. This package then allows to apply such measures on probability distributions resulting from random walks on tripartite graphs. By defining an initial distribution at a given level in the graph, a path within the three levels, and eventually a conditional step, the probability of the walker's position within the final level is then computed, thus providing a particular instance of diversity index.
