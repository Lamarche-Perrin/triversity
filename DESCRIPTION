Description: This R package implements a parametrised familly of measures quantifying the diversity of probability distributions. Sometimes called True Diversity, this familly contains famous measures such as Richness, the Shannon entropy, the Herfindahlâ€“Hirschman index, and the Berger-Parker index. This package then allows to apply such measures on the probability distributions resulting from random walks on tripartite graphs. By defining an initial distribution at a given level of the graph, a path within the three levels, and eventually a conditional step, then a probability distribution is obtained at a given final level, thus providing a particular instance of diversity.
