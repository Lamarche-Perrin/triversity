Description: Triversity is an R package for the computation of diversity measures on tripartite graphs. First, it implements a parametrized family of such diversity measures which apply on probability distributions. Sometimes called "True Diversity", this family contains famous measures such as the Richness, the Shannon entropy, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, and the Berger-Parker index. Second, the package allows to apply these measures on probability distributions resulting from random walks between the levels of tripartite graphs. By defining an initial distribution at a given level of the graph and a path to follow between the three levels, the probability of the walker's position within the final level is then computed, thus providing a particular instance of diversity to measure.
